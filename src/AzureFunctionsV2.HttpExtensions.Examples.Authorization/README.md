# Authentication/authorization example

This example project contains Functions with different authentication schemes applied to them
and serves as an example of how to set them up.

The actual setup code is in another project, __AzureFunctionsV2.HttpExtensions.Examples.Authorization.Startup__.
This is because the Functions runtime has a problem detecting Startup classes inside the main assembly.
